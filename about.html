	<h1>History</h1>
	<h4>The School on the Top of the Market</h4>
	<p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;In 1981, just before its second principal retired from service , she succeeded in her efforts to look for a more comfortable place for
	the teachers and students to stay. She was able to convince the Superintendent then, to intercede with the mayor to award the Obrero Market Building
	in the busy commercial district of Blumentritt, Sta. Cruz, Manila, to the Manuel L. Quezon High School. The building was intended as a market, but the
	vendors would not want to occupy the upper floors for obvious reasons, that no one of course would climb up to the second, third and fourth floors to
	buy their wares and so only the first of the building was occupied. At this time also the 2nd floor was occupied by the police for its precinct. So only
	the 3rd and 4th floors were available for use by the Manuel L. Quezon. Immediately upon approval, the city government restructured the Obrero Market
	Building into a school, leaving the police precinct in the second floor and the vendors in the ground floor.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;When the third and fourth floors were ready for occupancy, the Manuel L. Quezon High School transferred to the building and abandoned the Molave
	and Diaz Buildings but retained the Lerma Annex because it is just a stone’s throw from the Obrero Market Building. Since then, the school has remained
	in this building, the Obrero market Building: literally, the school on top of the “palengke” and police precinct.</p>
	<br>
	<div class="row featurette">
          <div class="col-md-7">     
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;A number of principals have come and gone to manage the school , each tried their best to improve and maintain the facilities
			and some  tirelessly did their best to intercede with the city officials in looking for available vacant lots in the area where it could construct
			a more decent and appropriate school for its teachers and students but all efforts were in vain.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="text-justify">Fortunately, indeed the second floor of the Obrero Market Building was vacated by the police when its transferred to the ground floor. The
			second floor was restructured into more classrooms and now occupied by the first year and second year levels.</p>
          </div>

          </div>
    </div>
	<p>The Lerma Annex was finally abandoned when the school acquired a three storey building constructed in that area through the efforts of the Congressman
	Jim Lopez of the Second District of Manila. This building is now occupied by the TLE and MAPEH classes.</p>
	<h4>MLQHS Permanent Building</h4>
	<div class="row featurette">
          <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">            
            <p class="text-justify">A few years ago, too, through the initiative of the alumni themselves who have yearned to give their alma mater a permanent
			decent school building of its own, the school administration was able to acquire a vacant lot in the corner of the Cavite Street and Jose Abad
			Santos Avenue. With the help of the then Congressman Nestor Ponce of the Second District of Manila; an alumnus of the school in coordination with
			the city government of Manila the construction of a permanent school building for Manuel L. Quezon High School was started. Unfortunately, the
			construction of the building has to stop when Congressman Ponce died to a vehicular accident. The unfinished building on its second floor is
			temporarily used by the Alternative Learning System (ALS) of the school; which caters to the out of the school youth and the school’s drop out.</p>

	<h5>THE ORIGIN</h5>

	<div class="row featurette">
          <div class="col-md-7">     
            <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;A number of principals have come and gone to manage the school , each tried their best to improve and maintain the facilities
			and some  tirelessly did their best to intercede with the city officials in looking for available vacant lots in the area where it could construct
			a more decent and appropriate school for its teachers and students but all efforts were in vain.</p>			
			<br>
          <p class="text-justify">&emsp;&emsp;Originally, the Manuel L. Quezon High School was an Annex of Arellano High School situated at Rizal Avenue
		  in 1952. When its population increased, it was separated from its mother school to become Rizal Avenue High School, an independent institution
		  in 1958, by virtue of an ordinance passed by the local Municipal Board of Manila, the name Rizal Avenue High School was changed to Manuel L. Quezon
		  High School in honor of the first President of the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines.</p>

            <img class="featurette-image img-fluid mx-auto" src="assets/img/C14.jpg" alt="Generic placeholder image" height="100%" width="100%">
          </div>
    </div>
	<br>
	<p class="text-justify">Since then, the school has withstood the challenges of serving the growing population in the district. Again when the school’s 
	population has grown bigger, its main building was transferred to Molave Street in the Tondo District. The School served the areas of Hermosa and
	Tambunting, the most thickly populated district, in addition to the Molave District in Tondo.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="text-justify">It was Molave when the school’s first principal was assigned to the head the school. Since it was newly transferred to the 
	two-storey wooden structure, the principal’s focus was on instruction and not much on improving its physical facilities. Moreover, the two-storey building
	was just enough to contain the students and teachers at the same time. Yet, the expansion was not really over-looked because after sometime, the school
	acquired another rented two-storey wooden structure to become the Diaz Annex situated just walking a distance from the Molave Main Building. A little
	later it acquired another rented building situated in the heart of the commercial district of Blumentritt and this became the Lerma Annex. It was at this
	time when its principal assigned the Lerma Annex for the first year and second year level; the third year level was assigned to the Diaz Annex and the 
	Main Building in Molave, solely for the fourth year level. It was also at this time when the students’ level of achievement was at its highest. The MLQHS
	students were as competitive and even winning against contestants from bigger opponents in any district competitions or in Division Level Competition as
	well. Even now when alumni of this school come around to visit the school during some important occasions they would recall their memorable and productive
	high school days in the Manuel L. Quezon High School.</p>
